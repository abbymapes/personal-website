              <p>DukeLife is an iOS mobile application in which Duke students can like, comment, and 
                  explore places around Durham. DukeLife aims to help students and visitors assimilate 
                  to life at Duke and take advantage of all the places Durham has to offer. DukeLife 
                  includes an interactive map of places displayed by categories, including food, coffee, 
                  bars and fun. Places are sorted by their popularity amongst students. As a student, 
                  you can like, comment, and post pictures for places, as well as add new spots in the 
                  Durham area to the app. As a guest, you can browse through students' favorite places 
                  in order to get a better sense of life at Duke, beyond traditional campus tours. 
                  I created this application in XCode, using Google Firebase, MapKit, and the Yelp API 
                  to initialize the app with over 200 places and provide search results for user queries.

              <p>As a Google STEP intern, I developed a full-stack web-based personal assistant 
                  that supports not only common Google Assistant tasks, but also unique add-on features. 
                  To do so, I trained conversational AI inputs via Dialogflow, a natural language understanding 
                  platform, and programmed backend fulfillment and frontend display to support all AI-ssistant 
                  features by using various Google APIs and services. I also designed and implemented a unique 
                  Books feature that creates a social books experience, allowing users to like, discover, and 
                  share books with their friends through our AI-ssistant.

              <img class = "ai-ssistant" src = "/images/Aether.jpg"></tr>
              <p>Aether is a social cryptocurrency exchange website. Beyond “buying” and “selling” cryptocurrencies, 
                  Aether allows users to be a part of a community of crypto-traders, by following like-minded traders, 
                  liking and commenting on transactions in their personalized feed, captioning their trades, viewing 
                  Aether’s top trades via the popular page and exploring recent trades for each currency. On their 
                  profile, users can view their recent trades, current balance, and portfolio information, reflecting 
                  their trade history and current holdings. In order to implement Aether, we used Firebase to store 
                  data, CoinGecko to retrieve and display real-time cryptocurrency prices, and Trading View to display 
                  interactive charts for each currency.

              <img class = "ai-ssistant" src = "/images/bluebook.jpg"></tr>
              <p>BlueBook acts like a social network for Duke students, centered around Duke’s course offerings, subjects, 
                  and graduation requirements. On BlueBook, Duke students can react to classes by liking, disliking, or 
                  adding courses to their wishlist. Students can learn more about each course via the course page– 
                  which includes a description of the course, the requirements that the course satisfies, an average 
                  “interesting” and “difficulty” rating, and comments about the course left by fellow Duke students. 
                  By adding other users as friends, students can view and comment on the classes that their friends 
                  have enjoyed, disliked, or want to take in their own personalized feeds. BlueBook aims to help guide 
                  students through the registration process, so they can explore more of the courses and opportunities that 
                  Duke has to offer. I created this website using Google Firebase and Duke's Curriculum API to retrieve 
                  information about course offerings.

              <p>Created an autocomplete program that considers terms 
                  starting with a user query and suggests possible completions for 
                  the user's typed text based on each term’s predetermined weight. By using a HashMap 
                  with prefix keys and corresponding weight-sorted lists of terms as 
                  values, the algorithm provides an O(1) implementation to return  
                  top matches for user queries, with a tradeoff of requiring more 
                  memory. <br>

              <p>Implemented a Huffman coding program that compresses data in a file by using fewer 
                  bits to encode frequently occurring characters. To do so, the program 
                  uses a tree that stores characters at its leaves and whose root-to-leaf 
                  paths define bit sequence encodings for each character. A greedy 
                  algorithm chooses the least-used characters to be the leaves at every 
                  level of the tree, ensuring that frequently used characters have the 
                  shortest bit encodings. <br>

              <p>Developed a Clever Hangman game that makes it harder for users to 
                  guess the program’s secret word. Instead of choosing one secret word at the 
                  beginning of the game, the “clever” program will change its secret word each 
                  time the user guesses a letter. Each change made by the program will 
                  maximize the number of possible secret words that fit in the template, 
                  while keeping all changes consistent with previously guessed letters. <br>

              <p>Created a cache simulator program that acts as a write-back and 
                  write-allocate cache. The program takes a file of load and store 
                  requests, cache size in KB, associativity, and block size in bytes 
                  as input parameters. For every access, the simulator prints out the 
                  kind of access, the hex address being accessed, and whether the access 
                  is a hit or a miss.<br>
